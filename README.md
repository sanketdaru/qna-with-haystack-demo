Build a QnA system using Haystack

## Pre-requisites
 1. Conda: Either Miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/main/miniconda.html) or Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

    a. Visual Studio Code with Jupyter Notebook (IPython Notebooks) Extension (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) OR  
    b. Jupyter Notebook (https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install.html)  

## Running the code
 1. Clone this repo on your local.  
 2. Create a Conda environment (a.k.a. virtual environment) for QnA related packages by executing the following  
    ```
    conda env create -f qna-env.yml
    ```  
 3. Activate the environment
    ```
    conda activate qna-env
    ```
 4. Open the .ipynb notebooks in Jupyter editor of your choice.  
 5. Make sure the Jupyter Notebook is using the Python binary from the Conda environment that was created in Step # 2.
